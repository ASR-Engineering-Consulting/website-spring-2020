# Hero section
title: Section 4
description: This section will teach you how to set up an end-to-end pipeline for training a model in Tensorflow or Pytorch. Specifically, we will cover (i) implementing a basic pipeline for classification on the MNIST dataset, (ii) modifying the pipeline to take in a custom dataset, and (iii) saving/loading a model.

Before getting started:
  - Open the [**tutorial**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lRitEHoEiJYPp53Wj8TtOWU6XuesgIx1), go to "File", and press "Save a copy in Drive...".
  - Download [**data.zip**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K2hSiWiufAglL8MoTrWdStuVA2WjiTQa/view), upload the .zip file into notebook by opening side menu (black arrow >), navigating to "Files" submenu, and pressing "Upload".

This tutoral is in Tensorflow, but we also provide an implementation in [Pytorch](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14h07IxOT22pCGkkUJXjKitYSeSbXrDbO).

# Basic Pipeline 
In this part, we’ll walk through a end-to-end pipeline for a classification task on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits that are 28x28 with labels 0-9 and can be loaded directly from Tensorflow.

  - **What are the steps for implementing an end to end pipeline?**

# Custom Dataloader

Most class projects use a dataset that is not available in Tensorflow/Pytorch. Let’s see how we can modify our pipeline to read in a custom dataset. We will do this by building a data loader object that will return a batch of (image, label) pairs on each call.

For this part, we will work with a sample of the SIGNS dataset. The dataset contains images of hand signs depicting numbers 0,1,2,3,4 and 5.

  - **Why do we need a data loader object? Can’t we just load the entire dataset in memory to use for training and testing?**
  - **Each image has a corresponding label (the number being depicted). What are some ways to store this mapping between images and labels?**

# Saving/Loading a model
Lastly, we’ll go over how to save and load a model in Tensorflow. You’ll need to save models from every experiment you run, so that you can then load the best model to evaluate on the test set. 


# Using a pre-trained CNN
In Part 1, we used a simple 2 layer neural network for the classification task. In this section, we’ll see how we can use a pre-trained CNN (pre-trained on ImageNet) for our task.
