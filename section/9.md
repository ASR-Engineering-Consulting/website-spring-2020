# Predictive Models

The choice of the correct evaluation metric will highly depend on the the task of your model.  Broadly speaking, predicitve neural networks will either need a regression metric or classification metric.

## Regression Metrics

### Mean Square Error (MSE)
### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Outliers, levarage

## Classification Metrics

### Accuracy

### Confusion Matrix

### Percision, Recall, F1 Score

### Area Under the Curve (AUC)


# How to evaluate a generative model?

GAN loss functions usually measure how well the generator fools the discriminator. That is, the generator weights are optimized to maximize the probability that any fake image is classified by the discriminator as belonging to the real dataset. 

However, GAN loss functions don’t measure the quality and diversity of the images generated. Thus, in order to benchmark GANs based on these two image criterions, we would need a new metric or procedure to compare them. 

## Inception Score

As mentioned above, we want to define a metric that returns a high score to GANs that output diverse and good quality images.

**What quantity could you maximize to check that the generated images are of high quality?**

One data driven way of making sure that the generated images are of high quality is by observing that is easy to infer the class of a high quality image with a NN classifier due to its high resolution (content of information) and their visual correspondence to the desired class (saliency). Mathematically, this is equivalent to say that the probability distribution of the class conditioned over an input image $$p(y\mid x)$$ has low entropy (highly spiked, concentrated). Hence the name of the metric: for estimating $$p(y\mid x)$$ the authors used a pretrained Inception network.

**How could you penalize GAN generators that don’t output diverse images?**

Diversity means having images from all the classes we are interested in. Using again the same statistical feature (the entropy), we can formulate mathematically a new figure of merit to award diversity in the generated images. How? By forcing the distribution of classes $$p(y)$$ of the generated dataset to have a high entropy. 

**How can be the entropy of $$p(y)$$ computed?** 

As we can estimate $$p(y\mid x)$$ with an Inception NN, $$p(y)$$ would be its marginal distribution.  As $$x = G(z)$$, $$p(y)$$ can be derived integrating over $$z$$ as follows:

$$\int_z p(y\mid x = G(z)) dz$$

**How you would combine in a single metric the previous two criterions?**

Using the KL divergence. Intuitively, the KL divergence can be thought as the “distance” in terms of similarity between two distributions.

The Inception score (of a Generator) is defined as follows:

$$IS(G) = exp()$$


If the images produced by the generative model are diverse and of high quality (i.e. $$p(y\mid x)$$ has low entropy and p(y)has high entropy), then we expect a large KL-divergence between the distributions p(y) and $$p(y\mid x)$$, resulting in a large IS. 

One shortcoming for IS is that it can misrepresent the performance if it only generates one image per class. p(y)will still be uniform even though the diversity is low.


## Frechet Inception Distance

This metric compares the statistics of the generated samples and real samples. It models both distributions as multivariate Gaussian. Thus, these two distributions can be compactly represented by their mean $$\mu$$ and covariance matrix $$\Sigma$$ exclusively. That is:

$$X_r\sim N(\mu_x,\Sigma_x) \text{ and } X_g\sim(\mu_g,\Sigma_g)$$

These two distributions are estimated with 2048-dimensional activations of the Inception-v3 pool3 layer for real and generated samples respectively. 

Finally, the FID between the real image distribution (Xr) and the generated image distribution (Xg) is computed as:

$$FID(x,g) = ||\mu_x - \mu_g||_2^2 + Tr(\Sigma_x + \Sigma_g - 2(\Sigma_x\Sigma_g)^{\frac{1}{2}})$$

Therefore, lower FID corresponds to more similar real and generated samples as measured by the distance between their activation distributions.
