# Running style transfer locally

 * You are working on a project entitled “Improving Neural Style Transfer”. If you were to plan your work, what would be the steps to carry-out?
 * As first step in your project’s implementation, you’d like to learn about existing implementations. Search online and choose a github repository that you think would be good to study.
 * What made you choose this github repository?
 * The github repository [neural-style](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style) seems to satisfy our criteria, let’s focus on it. Take 5 minutes to read and run the github repository on its inherent data. You should see the message “Iteration .../100”. What challenges did you encounter?
 * It seems that a few minutes is not enough to reproduce good results locally, what can you tweak to overcome this challenge?
 * Run this code on your chosen content and style images. Use 100 iterations.

This section was designed to help you get started with the existing code bases related to your project. Note that we only tested the model here, and did not train it. At home, find a github repository that is relevant to your project and try to reproduce the results.

Also, if you need a refresher on terminal or git fundamentals, you can have a look at this [tutorial](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/jd9nm7v2drf4bz/j7v7aqkb9194qv/jgic5sc45imn/CS230GithubTutorial.pdf).
