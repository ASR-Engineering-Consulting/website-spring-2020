# Welcome to CS230!

Talk about topics that students usually have questions about.
 * Groups of 1-3 students (4 ok if lot of work to do)
 * Main dates (01/15 form groups, 01/22 proposal, 02/19 milestone, 03/19 final report and poster)
 * Can combine project with other classes (need to write down in submissions + tailor it to the class + submit project for the other class)
 * Project office hours (15 mins per group per week with mandatory meetings for the first one, the week after proposal, the week after milestone)
 * Regular office hours (questions on the content of the class or assignments)

Now lets get a taste of what you will learn in CS230 and seem some cool demos of cutting edge deep learning.


# Applications of Deep Learning

A project in Deep learning can generally be classified by the type of data its working with.  Here are some interesting applications of deep learning.

## Computer Vision 


#### Image Classification

#### Object Detection

#### Image Segmentation


## Sequence Models

#### Speech Recognition
#### Time Series


## Miscellaneous
#### Generative Adversarial Networks

#### Autoencoders
#### Deep Reinforcement Learning



# Final Project

CS230 is unique in how much time we spend on the final project.

## What types of projects?

Historically, students who have succeeded in their CS230 projects have done one of the following:

 * **Used popular network architectures to perform a novel task.** For example, some students have used the YOLO algorithm to detect humans on images taken from their drones. They then cropped the humans out of the pictures and filled-in the humans position with the correct background using a Generative Adversarial Network. Another example: students have fine-tuned existing networks to perform state of the art accuracy in Tree Species Identification.
 * **Came up with a custom architecture to perform an existing (or novel task).** For example, students made changes to the popular U-net algorithm to improve performance on a chosen task such as brain tumor segmentation. Another example: students have improved accuracy on a task by adding and training an attention mechanism on top of the existing RNN architecture.
 * **Re-implemented a famous research paper.** For example, students have tried to re-implement the popular WaveNet algorithm with their own code.
 * **Did a research project.** For example, students have designed a neural network algorithm to debias word vectors using a novel technique. They then submitted their paper to a conference.

 Note that the common denominator of these projects is that students have contributed something *novel*. Of course, the above categories are not the only ones. We encourage students to talk with their mentors to figure out if their project idea is aligned with CS230â€™s expectations.
