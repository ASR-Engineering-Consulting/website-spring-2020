## Course Information

<<<<<<< HEAD
This quarter (Winter 2019), CS230 meets for in-class lecture Tue 10:30 AM - 11:50 PM, NVIDIA Auditorium

## Course Materials

#### Before the first class

If you are enrolled in CS230, you will receive an email from Coursera before the first day of class to join a private session of the course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning". Follow the instructions to setup your Coursera account with your Stanford email.

#### The flipped classroom format

CS230 is a flipped-room, every week you will have:
* In-class lectures on Tuesdays: these lectures will be a mix of advanced lectures on a specific subject that hasn't been treated in depth in the videos or guest lectures from industry experts.
* Two modules from the [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) on Coursera. You will watch videos at home, solve quizzes and programming assignments hosted on online notebooks. 
* TA-led sections on Fridays: Teaching Assistants will teach you hands-on tips and tricks to succeed in your projects, but also theorethical foundations of deep learning.
* Project meeting with your TA mentor: CS230 is a project-based class. Through personalized guidance, TAs will help you succeed in implementing a successful deep learning project within a quarter.


One module of the [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) on Coursera includes:

 * Lecture videos which are organized in "weeks". You will have to watch around 10 videos (more or less 10min each) every week.
 * Quizzes (≈10-30min to complete) at the end of every week to assess your understanding of the material.
 * Programming assignments (≈2h per week to complete). The programming assignments will usually lead you to build concrete algorithms, you will get to see your own result after you've completed all the code. It's gonna be fun! For both assignment and quizzes, follow the deadlines on the Syllabus page, not on Coursera.
