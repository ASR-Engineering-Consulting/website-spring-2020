# Course Information

CS230 meets every week for lecture Wed 11:30 AM - 12:50 PM, NVIDIA Auditorium

## Prerequisites
Students are expected to have the following background:
 * Knowledge of basic computer science principles and skills, at a level sufficient to write a reasonably non-trivial computer program.
 * Familiarity with the probability theory. (CS 109 or STATS 116)
 * Familiarity with linear algebra (any one of Math 104, Math 113, or CS 205)

## Course Materials
If you are enrolled in CS230, you must have received an email from Coursera confirming that you have been added to a private session of the course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning". Follow the instructions to setup your Coursera account with your Stanford email.

On the Coursera platform, you will find:
 * Lecture videos which are organized in "weeks". You will have to watch around 10 videos (more or less 10min each) every week. Make sure you are up to date, to not lose the pace of the class.
 * Quizzes (≈10-30min to complete) at the end of every week. These quizzes are here to assess your understanding of the material.
 * Programming assignments (≈2h per week to complete). The programming assignments will usually lead you to build concrete algorithms, you will get to see your own result after you've completed all the code. It's gonna be fun! For both assignment and quizzes, follow the deadlines on the Syllabus page, not on Coursera.

In addition to the content on Coursera, you will have:
 * In-class lectures on Wednesdays: these lectures will be a mix of advanced lectures on a specific subject that hasn't been treated in depth in the videos or guest lectures from industry experts.
 * Sections on Fridays: Teaching Assistants will hold Hands-on Sections to teach you advanced materials including hands-on tips and tricks to succeed in your projects, or mathematical proofs.
 * 15min weekly project mentorship with your mentor TA: CS230 is a project-based class. Through personalized guidance, TAs will help you succeed in implementing a successful deep learning project within a quarter.
